Performing circuit analysis by hand makes engineers sad, its much better to simulate it! CircuitVision allows you to scan any circuit schematic using your phone or webcam, then using some fancy computer vision tricks it reconstructs it in the opensource Falstad Simulator where you can visualise the path of electrons and instantly perform all the circuit analysis your heart desires. Currently functional for circuits containing any combination of resistors, capcitors, inductors and voltage/ current sources.

Soon to be expanded to more complex componentary!
